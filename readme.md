- Design patterns (Singleton, Observer, Factory)

## üéØ **Key Features:**

1. **Practical Examples**: Every concept has working code you can run
2. **Progressive Learning**: Organized from basic to advanced
3. **Modern C++**: Includes C++11/14/17 features
4. **Best Practices**: Shows proper memory management and coding style
5. **Real-world Applications**: Design patterns and practical scenarios

## üöÄ **How to Use This Guide:**

1. **Compile and Run**: Use `g++ -std=c++14 -pthread -o guide guide.cpp`
2. **Study Systematically**: Follow the numbered sections in order
3. **Practice**: Modify the examples and create your own variations
4. **Build Projects**: Apply concepts in personal coding projects

## üìù **Learning Path:**

Start with basics (sections 1-3), master OOP (sections 4-6), learn STL thoroughly (7-8), then progress to advanced topics. Each section builds upon previous knowledge.

This guide will give you a solid foundation in C++ programming with practical, runnable examples for every important concept!
